It highlights the shift from opportunistic transactions to strategic redefinition, driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), stabilizing monetary policies, and geopolitical reconfiguration.
Current Market Valuation: The analysis covers a rebound in global deal value to $4.3T – $4.8T (up ~36-39% YoY).
